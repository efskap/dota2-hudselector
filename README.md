dota2-hudselector
=================

Mods in any Dota 2 HUD as the default. Completely legal, as it simply extracts data from Dota 2's own game files, and disguises it as something else.

Uses the excellent [HLExtract tool](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=35).

Requirements
===

- Python 3

So far I only have automatic installation location detection for Windows, but if you manually specify the path to Steam as an argument, it should work on Linux too.


Instructions
===
Run with python 3, pick your HUD, and then choose "Default HUD" from the shared content menu in-game.
