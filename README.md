DOES NOT WORK WITH REBORN :(
===

Replaces the default HUD with any other HUD in the game. Completely legal (and VAC-proof, etc), as it simply extracts data from Dota 2's own game files and then mods it back in.
Uses the excellent [HLExtract tool](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=35).

Requirements
===

- Python 3 (if not using binary)
- Windows (Linux untested)


Instructions
===

Run main.py with python 3 (Or download hudselector.zip and run the Windows binary), pick your HUD, and then choose "Default HUD" from the shared content menu in-game.

**YOU MUST HAVE -override_vpk IN YOUR DOTA 2 LAUNCH OPTIONS FOR THIS TO WORK**, just like with any other mod.
